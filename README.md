# Karacter

Kotlin Character

## Building

Please note, the tests currently need the tip of master branch of Spek.  Use
of JUnit5 M4 is in the Spek repo, but not yet published, so a build needs to
first install Spek locally.

## TODO

* Externalize display representation, ala avoid `toString`
* Does attunement work?
* Immutability is imperfect, see `SetPad`
* Concurrency safety
